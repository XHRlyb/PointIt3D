### Abstract

Pointed object detection is of great importance for human-machine interaction, but attempts to solve this task may run into the difficulties of lack of available large scale datasets since people hardly record 3D scenes with a human pointing at specific objects. In efforts to mitigate this gap, we cultivate the first benchmark dataset for this task: PointIt3D, containing 347 scans now and can be easily scaled up to facilitate future utilizations, which is automatically constructed from existing 3D scenes from ScanNet[1] and 3D people models using our novel synthetic algorithm that achieves a high acceptable rate of more than 85% according to three expertsâ€™ assessments, which hopefully would pave the way for further studies. We also provide a simple yet effective baseline based on anomaly detection and majority voting pointline generation to solve this task based on our dataset, which achieves accuracy of 55.33%, leaving much room for further improvements. Code will be released at https://github.com/XHRlyb/PointIt3D.
